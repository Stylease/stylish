                <p> Despite its inception and fashion debut in the limelight just a short few months ago, Stylease
                    has quickly lured a loyal and loving community of convenience-conscious, classy, capricious, couture-crazy
                    customers - and how we love them all. </p>
                <p> Our collection is renewed and expanded each month so we keep ourselves on our toes and our customers out
                    of their fashion woes!</p>
                <p class="paddab">Having gained invaluable expertise and edge from experience so far - Stylease has also conceptualised its
                    own set of pieces called The Stylease Exclusive. This range is the result of daunting design expertise,
                    tireless craftsmanship and an unwavering wish to stay a step ahead of the trends.</p>
